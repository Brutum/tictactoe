# Separating the game logic and displaying

Currently, the code is a piece of spaghetti.

You will organize the code by first separating the game logic, put it in the
`Game` class, and the displaying code (all the `cout` crap).

## Game class

The `Game` class will hold all the states associated with the game itself, such
as the board, whose turn it is, and the game over conditions. The class will be
"passive". It will not progress the game on its own; rather, it will have
methods that controls the current game state. The `Game` class should have a
constructor, `check_move` method to check if a move is valid, `make_move` method
to commit the move, `check_win` method to check if a player has won,
`get_current_player` method to get current player, and `get_board` method to get
board status at the position specified. It will also have `enum Player`.

```c++
class Game {

    // member variables...

public:
    enum Player { X, O, NONE };

    Game();
    bool check_move(unsigned int row, unsigned int col);
    Player check_win();
    Player get_board(unsigned int row, unsigned int col);
    Player get_current_player();
};
```

## Display abstract class

We will also have `Display` class that we can derive from to display the board
to the user. We will have `DisplayTerminal` to display with `cout` and
`DisplaySfml` to display with SFML graphics library.

## Input abstract class

We will have `Input` class that we can derive from to get input from various
sources. Like `Display` class, we will have `InputTerminal` and `InputSfml`.
