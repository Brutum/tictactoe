# Root Directory

This is **the** root directory of the repository.

Its content includes `README.md` (this file), `Tupfile` (the file used for build
system), `src` directory (where sources that has to be compiled, `.cpp` files
are), and `include` directory (where header files, `.hpp` files are).

By no means the directory structure is the standard. I happen to use this one
for better organization of code. If you have better suggestion, feel free to
tell me.

We will use Tup for build system. More information can be found
[here](http://gittup.org/tup/).
